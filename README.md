## Introduction:
   Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
  
## A Description of the Project:
  The project uses Python programming language to randomly select a secret word and allow a player to guess letters with limited chances to win. If a guessed letter appears in the word, all instances are revealed. If     not, the player loses a chance. The important learning outcomes from this project are:
  Object oriented Programming.
  Git & Github (Version Control).
  Project Documentation as PEP8 standard.
  Conda Enviornment.
      
## The Aim of the Project:
   The aim of the project is to solve the puzzle and guess the correct word before running out of lives/chances. 
      
## What I have Learned
 I have learnt alot in the past 3 weeks since I started the Hangman project. Most importantly, I have a better understanding of object-oriented programming, Git and Github, and I have learnt and enjoyed debugging        throughout my project phase as every milestones comes with its own unique challenges.
