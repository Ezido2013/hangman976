## Table of Contents
- A description of the project:
  - What it does:
    Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
    This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.
  - The aim of the project
    The project uses Python programming language to randomly select a secret word and allow a player to guess letters with limited chances to win.
    If a guessed letter appears in the word, all instances are revealed. If not, the player loses a chance.
    The goal is to guess the word before running out of chances.
